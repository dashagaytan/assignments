 **Part 1 - GET**
- The user can see their current list of todos.
- Todos show up as soon as the page loads.
- If a todo item is complete, it should have a strikethrough line on it
- Images should be displayed as images if there are any


 **Part 2 - POST**
- The user can add new todos to their list. The new item should be posted to the todo API so a future reload of the page will still 
display that new todo item. Making the new todo appear without a refresh is extra credit, but you're encouraged to attempt it.
- A user should be able to give the item a title.
- A user should be able to give the item a price.
- A user should be able to give the item a description.
- A user should be able to attach an imgUrl to the item

// We are traveling back in time to 1985. Our goal is to build a text-based RPG game.
// ****** Project Requirements **********

// 1. We must greet our user 
// 2. Ask for user name and give them a chance to name thier player
// 3. The user will be prompted to enter "w" to start walking
// 4. We will run a random algorithm for everytime the user walks which will determine the chances of an enemy appearing 
// - there will be 1/3 or 1/4 chance of being attack by a wild enemy
// - in chance of an enemy appearing (1 out of 3 random): 
// - user will can decide to ether ATTACK or RUN. 
// - if ATTACKING: damage will be dealt between a min and max
// - if RUNNING: 50% chance of escaping
// - enemy will attack back for a random damage amount 
// - we will use a LOOP while the player and enemy attack each other until one ether passes out or dies
// - if player kills the enemy: player gets health points (HP) & a special item for their inventory. Player walks on
// - if enemy kills the player: game ends with a "sad message" like "GAME OVER !! YOU'RE DEAD" 
// 5. INVENTROY: 
// - player gets an award if enemy is killed
// - user will be able to enter "Print" or "p" to see their details: name, HP, and each inventroy item
